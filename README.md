# Base X converter

Coverts base-8, base-16, base-32 and base-64 to byte array and vice-versa. 

## About The Project

Build to convert byte patterns to base-X conversion.
- Base-8:
Can be used to enter a byte with a basic keyboard.
- Base-16:
Is a half byte and needs no padding bit.
It can be used on a hex keyboard
- Base-32:
Most used for secrets in cryptographic as it can be entered with a basic keyboard.
The keyboard needs only the letters and the A-Z and 2-7.
For padding, the character = is used.
- Base-64:
It increases the base-32 with lowercase letters, the full decimal digits and two special characters.
It can also be entered with the basic keyboard.
